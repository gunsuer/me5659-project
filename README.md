[State-space control of an inverted pendulum balance system](main.pdf)

We study the nonlinear, inherently unstable inverted pendulum. The goal is to maintain the
pendulum angle $\theta(t) = 0$ by using a feedback controller with some sensors and an actuator to produce an
input force $f(t)$. The cart has mass $m_1$, the pendulum point has mass $m_2$, and we assume that the pendulum
rod is massless. There are two possible outputs, the pendulum angle $\theta(t)$ and the cart displacement $w(t)$.
